Update1 - Segmentation algorithm is working. I generated a simple 600x450 jpg image with random symbols and numbers. The segment.py is able to identify each symbol. The segments are then saved to an pickle file.


Update2- The Classifier finally ran using the dataset. The results were pretty bad, the loss went up and accuracy went down after 2500 steps.
